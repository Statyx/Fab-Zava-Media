/**
 * Route manifest.
 *
 * The sibling console shipped a first cut with two entries — Home and one "Cockpit" that
 * stacked every panel into a single scrolling column. Every card on the cover pointed at it,
 * so six different questions had one destination and the app read as a single screen with a
 * chat beside it. Do not reintroduce that under another name.
 *
 * The sections below are the four questions a media agency console is actually asked, in the
 * order they get asked:
 *
 *  - **Portfolio** — where do things stand, and where do I start looking.
 *  - **Delivery**  — what was planned, what ran, and by how much it missed.
 *  - **Contracts** — what the text says, with no figure in sight.
 *  - **Billing**   — what was spent, what was billed, and what is about to lapse.
 *
 * There is exactly **one** navigation. The sibling app's worst structural failure was two
 * navigations over the same subject: a four-step arc holding every chart and no chat, beside
 * four personas holding every chat and no chart.
 *
 * The diagnostic route deliberately does NOT appear here. It exists, it is reachable by URL,
 * and it is not in the nav: a route nobody links to costs nothing on screen, and deleting it
 * would mean a rebuild plus a redeploy to get the diagnostic back at the exact moment the app
 * is already failing.
