/**
 * The assistant, pinned to a rail.
 *
 * ── Shape ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The user's question is a right-aligned accent bubble, the answer a left-aligned card, with
 * a step trace while the agent works and a free-text box so this is something you can talk to
 * rather than a menu of six buttons. Every colour resolves through the theme variables: an
 * early cut hardcoded `bg-white` and the `text-gray-*` ramp and left a white column down the
 * side of a dark console.
 *
 * It stays a rail — a fixed column at the edge, never half the screen. A half-and-half split
 * reads as "a chat app that happens to show a network", which inverts the product: the console
 * has to keep working on its own, with the assistant available at the side.
 *
 * ── What this rail refuses to do ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything below exists to stop the assistant looking more certain than it is. In order of
 * how badly each one would mislead a room:
 *
 *  1. **It shows what actually ran, not what was supposed to run.** Every suggestion declares
 *     up front what it expects to consult. After the answer, the rail shows what really fired
 *     — and lets it contradict the expectation. A console that only ever displays its own
 *     intentions is describing itself, not reporting.
 *  2. **An answer with no source says so, loudly.** Zero sources is not a rendering edge case,
 *     it is the single most important thing on screen: the model answered from itself.
 *  3. **It never animates work it cannot see.** The trace marks the hops the browser genuinely
 *     observes over HTTP. What happens inside the run — choosing a source, writing the query —
 *     is named, but greyed and labelled as unmeasured.
 *  4. **A replayed answer admits it.** A recording renders exactly like a live answer, which
 *     is precisely why the disclosure is mandatory rather than tasteful.
 *  5. **Provenance is kept but folded.** The agent returns its query and its tables; that is
 *     what makes the answer checkable. It sits one click away instead of drowning the prose.
 */

/**
 * Fabric's own vocabulary, translated for the operations floor.
 *
 * The names on the left are what the run steps return. The names on the right are what the
 * room needs: which body of data was consulted. Anything unrecognised passes through
 * unchanged — an unfamiliar true name is far better than a friendly wrong one, and a silent
 * fallback to "data" would erase exactly the evidence this badge exists to show.
 *
 * The first block was written against `itemReference.itemType`, which is what the runs were
 * expected to report. Six real captures report **none of it**: every one comes back as
 * orchestration step names instead. So the second block is the one that actually fires, and
 * without it the evidence line — the single most important line in this console — renders as
 * `generate.filename · analyze.database.execute · trace.analyze_ontology`. Both blocks stay:
 * the run shape is the agent's to change, and passing through is only safe for names nobody
 * has seen yet.
