/**
 * Where the numbers come from, stated in one place.
 *
 * The sister console shipped a bundled data set beside the live one, so this module was a
 * genuine switch. This app has no bundled data at all — every figure on every screen is a
 * measure evaluated against the semantic model at render time. That is deliberate: there is a
 * governed model here, so an app that could quietly diverge from `Zava_Media_Report` would be
 * demonstrating the opposite of what it claims.
 *
 * So `demo` no longer means "bundled data". It means **not connected**, and the badge has to
 * say so plainly. A console showing a confident zero because its configuration is missing is
 * the single worst thing this app could do in front of a room.
