/**
 * Replay of pre-recorded agent answers, for the opening clicks of a demo.
 *
 * A real answer from the Fabric Data Agent costs 40-160 seconds, because the work happens on
 * the data side: the agent picks a source, writes the query, Fabric runs it, and only then is
 * there prose. That is the right trade for a genuine question and the wrong one for the first
 * click in front of a room, where a minute of spinner is a minute of dead air — and the moment
 * an audience decides the console is slow rather than thorough.
 *
 * So the questions the console itself suggests can be answered from a recording.
 *
 * Two rules make that acceptable, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **Nothing here is written by hand.** `scripts/capture_frozen_answers.py` asks the live
 *     Data Agent and stores what came back, together with the sources that really fired and the
 *     time it really took. It refuses to record an answer where nothing fired. A hand-written
 *     answer would look exactly as sourced as a real one — same prose, same provenance block,
 *     same route badges — while being a fabrication, and nobody in the room could tell.
 *
 *     That capture script does not exist yet, and until it does this file holds nothing. The
 *     order is deliberate: the recording cannot be written before the chain it records has been
 *     measured, and writing the answers first — by hand, to have something to show — is exactly
 *     the failure this rule forbids. An empty replay is honest; a hand-seeded one is not.
 *
 *  2. **The replay says so.** The wait names it, and the answer carries the capture date and
 *     the duration the agent actually took. An undisclosed cache would break the same contract
 *     the muted trace dot exists to protect: never present something as observed when it was
 *     not.
 *
 * A miss is fail-safe: the question goes to the live agent exactly as before. Missing a
 * recording costs latency, never correctness — which is why a partial capture, or none at all,
 * is still worth shipping.
