 * conversation pane would widen with the window and the app would read as "a
 * chat that happens to have charts". A rail assigns growth, and for a data app
 * the pane allowed to grow is the content.
 *
 * The rail is mounted here rather than inside each page, so switching sections
 * keeps the thread. The cover deliberately sits outside this layout: it is a
 * choice of where to go, not a place to work.
