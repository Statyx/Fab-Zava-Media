/**
 * Entry point for the MSAL redirect landing page (`blank.html`).
 *
 * MSAL v5 no longer polls the popup's URL for the auth response: the opener waits on a
 * `BroadcastChannel` keyed by the request state, and the landing page is responsible for
 * publishing the response onto it. `broadcastResponseToMainFrame()` parses the response out of
 * this URL, posts it, and closes the window.
 *
 * A landing page that does nothing is therefore not neutral — it is a dead end. The opener waits
 * out its timeout and rejects with `BrowserAuthError: timed_out` (subcode
 * `redirect_bridge_timeout`), which reads like a network or consent problem and is neither. The
 * same channel carries the silent-renewal response from the hidden iframe.
