/**
 * Emit the capture list from the question registry.
 *
 *     cd app && npx tsx scripts/freeze-questions.ts
 *
 * The list exists as a file because the recorder is Python and the registry is TypeScript, and
 * the alternative — retyping the prompts on the Python side — is the one thing that must not
 * happen here. A prompt that drifts by a word stops matching at replay: `frozenAnswer()` keys on
 * the exact prompt sent, so a stale copy does not fail loudly, it simply never hits, and the
 * demo quietly goes back to waiting 40-160 seconds with nobody able to say why.
 *
 * That is why this is generated, and why the drift test compares the file against OPENERS on
 * every run: the divergence is caught at build time rather than in front of a room.
